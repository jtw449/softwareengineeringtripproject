## Trip Information

**Departure Date/Time**: Friday, May 11 at 5 p.m. We want to visit before the summer rush begins, so we can minimize time wasted sitting in traffic or waiting in line behind other visitors. We would leave Columbia right after exams are over on Friday. This would give us an ETA of around 11 a.m. on Saturday in Orlando. Driving through the night would allow us to avoid a lot of traffic, hitting major cities like St. Louis, Nashville, and Atlanta during off-peak traffic times. With four people going on the trip, we could rotate drivers, so everyone gets to sleep during the drive.
