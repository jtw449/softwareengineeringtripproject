# Hotel
We will be utilizing [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) to handle the accommodations
for our stay in Orlando.

### We will be staying at a [beautiful and modern home with a pool](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14662246?s=51)
This home is very spacious and has 5 beds. This means that everyone will get their own bed and we will have an extra guest bed for any pals we befriend on the trip. The pool will also be a great place for us to chill when we aren't out riding gnarly waves.

The home is also very affordable for our budget. The rate is $124 per night or $1,299 total for 7 days (with taxes and fees included).

## TO-DO
Need to wait until we have our dates picked out to ensure the home is available.
