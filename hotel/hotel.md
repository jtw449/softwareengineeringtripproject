### We will be staying at a [brand new 4 bedroom town home!](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/14520119?s=51)
This home is very spacious and has 6 beds. This means that everyone will get their own bed and we will have an extra guest bed for any pals we befriend on the trip. The luxurious space will be perfect for our budget and provide us with a great space to play. 

The home is also very affordable for our budget. The rate is $158 per night or $1,300 total for 6 nights (with taxes and fees included).
